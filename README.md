# gitt
Mathematical routines written for Mathematica® technical platform to solve Partial Differential Equations by means of the GITT - Generalized Integral Transform Technique.

The folder gitt-mathematica-2 contains the original version, published in 1996 as part of the Andrade's dissertation: http://mdcc.ufc.br/teses-e-dissertacoes/dissertacoes-de-mestrado/doc_download/2-002-francisco-edmundo-de-andrade

The folder gitt-mathematica-4 contains the code migrated in 2002 to work on Mathematica® 4: http://library.wolfram.com/infocenter/Demos/4549/

The folder gitt-mathematica-10 contains the code migrated in 2016 to work on Mathematica® 10.

The packages citt.m and gitt.m must be present in a folder Calculus, below one of the $Path directories. Examples: {MATHEMATICA_HOME}/AddOns/Packages/Calculus, {USER_HOME}/Calculus.

To run the provided examples, open the notebook GITTSAMP.nb (earlier GITSAMP.MA) in Mathematica® platform.
